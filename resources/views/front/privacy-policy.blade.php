A cookie is a small file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows Us or Our business partners to recognize your device when you return to Our Service and record information about your usage of Our Services.</p>

<p>We use cookies for five general purposes as follows:</p>

<ol class="font12">
	<li><strong>Essential Operational: </strong>Cookies are necessary to allow Us to operate Our Services. For example, they are required to help you access secure areas (such as your account pages) and to use features like Our shopping basket.</li>

<p>You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits; although, by declining the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on, and significant portions of, Our Site. Also, because information we obtain may be combined, we may still be able to identify your web browser, computer or mobile device when you access Our Services even if you disable cookies. Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked.
